1. Modification of Destination
Customers should not be able to modify the destination of an order once it has been shipped.
Proposed solution: Check the order status before allowing modifications.

2. Database Concurrency Issues
Database operations can lead to dirty reads and writes.
Proposed solution: Set the database isolation level to serializable to improve isolation and resolve concurrency issues.

3. Data Operation Failure
There is a lack of proper error handling when database operations fail.
Proposed solution: Roll back any transactions that fail.

4. Insufficient Exception Handling:
When errors occur in the project, they are only printed out, which may sometimes expose them to the client without an
effective resolution mechanism.
Proposed Solution: Implement a exception handling mechanism, which should catch and log errors internally while
providing a generic error message to the client to prevent the exposure of sensitive details.

5. Server Resource Leaks:
Currently, we connect to UPS and the world through two sockets.
In the event of exceptions and errors, they may not be properly closed, leading to prolonged resource consumption.
Proposed Solution: Ensure that socket connections to UPS and other services are enclosed within a try-finally block or
use context managers to guarantee that resources are released appropriately even in the event of an error.
